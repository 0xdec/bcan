# Beacon IR Protocol
The beacon IR protocol is modulated with a carrier frequency of 38kHz. One bit length is defined as 960us, or roughly 36.5 oscillations of the carrier frequency. Each frame starts with a high signal for three bit lengths followed by a low signal for one bit length. The frame's data payload then begins, and has a nominal length of 16 bits. Each bit is represented using manchester encoding as per G.E. Thomas' convention. That is, a logical zero is represented by a low signal for 480us followed by a high signal for 480us, equivalent to a rising edge at the center of the bit length. A logical one is represented by a high signal for 480us followed by a low signal for 480us, equivalent to a falling edge at the center of the bit length. The frame ends with a low signal for four bit lengths, upon which a new frame may begin.
